## Assignment: 

This assignment introduces you to the concept of cultural mapping. It is intended to stimulate you to think about this bit of American culture (which probably is C1—the first culture—for many of you), in preparation for studying the cultures of Asia and for fieldwork in country in January.

The DJJD is an annual Northfield festival that provides us a great chance to look at American culture. We will assign you to groups of three. You should equip yourselves with a camera and a notebook, and prepare to work on this project as a group from start to finish.

1. Pick a time to attend the Festival. It runs Friday-Sunday, September 6-8. Plan to spend several hours at the festival.
2. Pick up brochures created for the event or peruse the web description to get a sense of the way in which the community of Northfield presents this festival. What is valued? How would you categorize the festival? What are the important parts of it?
3. Choose one activity or site to observe carefully. Note what you see & hear: Who is there? What is happening? Which languages/dialects are used? Who is speaking to whom?
4. Take numerous photos of the site or activity. Afterward, choose just one photo that seems emblematic or especially rich for what they tell us about cultural practice as you see it in DJJD.
5. For class on Tuesday, September 11, be prepared to describe your site or activity. What is valued? What is 'apparent'? What requires more background or context? Show your photo as part of your evidence for your analysis.
6. Post one page that includes your thesis about the cultural presentation and assumptions of DJJD and your supporting evidence to your e-portfolio. You may choose to link your project among the members of your group.
